Mark Fanelli And Ziyuan Zhu
# **Term Project Proposal**

## **Big Idea**
* Our project is created to help convert currency from around the world with each other real time. We figured that this was interesting and applicable to Babson students because we are all from different parts of the world, thus, we use different forms of currencies in our home countries. 

Our minimum viable product is to create a website that requires user input of whatever amount they want and be able to convert the output of another currency amount with a click of a button. 

Our stretch goal is to potentially showcase the historical rates of each form of currency with the final result.

## **Learning Goals**
* Ziyuan: One of my learning goals is to gain a deeper understanding of the real life applications of Python, specifically in web application and internet development, and learning how to collaborate in such an intense project. 
* Mark:  My personal goal for this project is to further learn how to write Python code in an efficient manner as well as gaining more experience in using a coding language to solve problems, which can be very valuable in the long run.
* Shared goal: We want to learn how to work on a coding project in a team setting and learn how to share and collaborate. 


## **Implementation Plan**
* So far, our plan is to import a json file of all the currencies and its rates. After completing the coding, we will import flask in order to enable the user interaction. 

## **Collaboration Plan**
* We plan on pair programming the entire project since we both live on campus at close proximity. However, we both know that if our schedule does not match up at one point, we will complete our part independently and then integrate our codes, if needed. We feel that this particular organizational structure will not only hold us accountable but to share knowledge that we both may or may not know already.

## **Risks**
* The biggest risk to the success of our project is the team’s limited coding knowledge. Prior to the course, we had absolutely zero knowledge on Python. We feel that we are still beginners and creating such a project may seem unrealistic since we might not be able to learn everything we need. 
* Another risk would be the team’s time management. We say time management because both team members are involved with extracurricular activities outside of the classroom. Mark is a student athlete on the swim team, while Ziyuan is an executive member of the school’s Asian Pacific Student Association. 


## **Additional Course Content**
* We would be interested in learning how exactly to proceed with html website creating through Python.
