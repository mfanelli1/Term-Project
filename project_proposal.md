# **Term Project Proposal**

## **Big Idea**
* Our project is created to help Babson College students decide which vacation destination they should visit during school breaks. We will divide this by weekend trips (3 days), long weekend trips (4-6 days) and break trips (2 weeks - a month). After the user inputs their vacation preference, it will then ask their input again on what kind of vacation they would like to go on. Some possibilities may be a relaxing vacation, an adventurous vacation, a historical/information vacation, etc. Through this project, we wish to come up with a product that can help minimize the stress that comes with deciding which vacation destination to choose. The minimum viable product would be a website that would ask for the user’s vacation type. A stretch goal would be to offer the price of the whole vacation


## **Learning Goals**
* Ziyuan: One of my learning goals is to gain a deeper understanding of the real life applications of Python, specifically in web application and internet development, and learning how to collaborate in such an intense project. 
* Mark:  My personal goal for this project is to further learn how to write Python code in an efficient manner as well as gaining more experience in using a coding language to solve problems, which can be very valuable in the long run.
* Shared goal: We want to learn how to work on a coding project in a team setting and learn how to share and collaborate. 


## **Implementation Plan**
* So far, our plan is to create a file that consists of possible vacation destinations for Babson students. We will be compiling all this information on an Excel. Then, we will need to learn a bit of information on HTML to create a website that’s integrated with our python code, so users will be able to use it.

## **Project Schedule** 
* First, we will first look up websites that may provide information on popular vacation destinations. Then, we will start to brainstorm on the website’s UI and UX aspect. Then, we will start working on writing the code that will ask for the user’s input on their preference for what kind of vacation destination they would like to travel to. Our team is planning to meet once a week on Mondays from approximately 5:00 - 6:30 pm. If needed, we will work on other weekdays/weekends to finish up tasks, so that we stay on schedule.


## **Collaboration Plan**
* We plan on pair programming the entire project since we both live on campus at close proximity. However, we both know that if our schedule does not match up at one point, we will complete our part independently and then integrate our codes, if needed. We feel that this particular organizational structure will not only hold us accountable but to share knowledge that we both may or may not know already.

## **Risks**
* The biggest risk to the success of our project is the team’s limited coding knowledge. Prior to the course, we had absolutely zero knowledge on Python. We feel that we are still beginners and creating such a project may seem unrealistic since we might not be able to learn everything we need. 
* Another risk would be the team’s time management. We say time management because both team members are involved with extracurricular activities outside of the classroom. Mark is a student athlete on the swim team, while Ziyuan is an executive member of the school’s Asian Pacific Student Association. 


## **Additional Course Content**
* We would be interested in learning how exactly to proceed with website creating through Python.
